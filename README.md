## Get going quickly using Cyber-Dojo

I've also set this kata up on [cyber-dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org) for several languages, so you can get going really quickly:

- [JUnit, Java](http://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork/751DD02C4C?avatar=snake&tag=8)
- [C#](http://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork/5C5AC766B0?avatar=koala&tag=3)
- [C++](http://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork/AA86ECBCC9?avatar=rhino&tag=7)
- [Ruby](http://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork/A8943EAF92?avatar=hippo&tag=9)
- [RSpec, Ruby](http://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork/8E58B0AD16?avatar=raccoon&tag=3)

## Better Code Hub

I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!
